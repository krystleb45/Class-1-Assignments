    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I am married, have three kids, a dog. We will soon have some chickens and some other animals! I love to do wood working and make tables and other things that people ask me to make them! I think I really enjoy coding becuase I really enjoy math, if its right it works and if its not it <em>doesn't.</em> .</p>
